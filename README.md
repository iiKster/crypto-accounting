Bash scripts to help you keep track of the coins you have mined

In some countries you have to declare and pay tax on the fair market value of the coin you have mined eaven if you coose to hodl (hold) the coins.  The acounting can be a pain so some sctipts got created.

Here you will only find bash scripts for linux, no windows / mac / nintendo or playstation script are available as I only use linux rigs and desktops for my mining operation.

By default the scripts use EURO as fiat currensy and european date format, these can be edited in the code, there are merckers ---FIAT--- and ---DATE--- at the corresponding places.

Dependencies:
JQ to handle json data from pools, explorers and other APIs
AWK to handle float values as bash only 
Curl to fetch data
