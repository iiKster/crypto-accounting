Bash scripts to help you keep track of the coins you have mined

In some countries you have to declare and pay tax on the fair market value of the coin you have mined even if you choose to hodl (hold) the coins. The accounting can be a pain if the pool doesn't allow to set a higher payout threshold so some scripts got created.

Here you will only find bash scripts for linux, no windows / mac / nintendo or playstation script are available as I only use linux rigs and desktops for my mining operation so I can't test them. You are free to make scripts for other platforms based on mine.

By default the scripts use EURO as fiat currency and European date format, these can be edited in the code, there are markers ---FIAT--- and ---DATE--- at the corresponding places.

Dependencies: 
JQ to handle json data from pools, explorers and other APIs. 

AWK to handle float values as bash only understands int. 

Curl to fetch data.

---------------The files---------------
logExpDwarf.sh :  Logs Expanse EXP coins from dwarfpool.com
logGin:           Logs Gin Coins from all pools


----------------------------------------

The scripts are free, as in free beer.
