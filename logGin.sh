# A script that checks your Gin Coin balance with a set intervall (5 min as default) and writes the changes to a  CSV file,
# the file contains the date, payout amount in coins, the coin/BTC value and Euro/value.
# If you want to use a different FIAT currency or date format please edit the code under the lines  ---DATE--- and ---FIAT---
# All the echo lines that has been commented out are used for testing / debugging.
# If you run the script with the @reboot flag from crontab please specify the full path to the file.
# Dependencies: Curl, JQ.  (run "sudo apt-get install curl"  and  "sudo apt-get install jq"

# The script is free to use but I don't mind if you treat me to a Gin (tonic)  GZqfL7xZPZ3hYcMFnfgtEcNkofKimJbks1
